I am a computer scientist with focus is on image analysis, programming theory,
and machine learning, but I tend to get involved in any problem that can fit in
the memory of a computer (and sometimes on problems that cannot really fit).

I am native of Sardinia, where I studied music and math. After earning my
diploma in viola and a couple degrees in math and computer science, I moved to
Sweden for my master studies in computer science at Uppsala University, where I
am now employed as a Ph.D. student in digital image analysis.

I love opera and classical music.  I am an enthusiast [Arch
Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) user.

I am not into social media, but you can still find on the web some activities
related to my work:

- My [PGP
    key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xCDEE463095565E17).
- My [GitHub profile](https://github.com/m-pilia).
- The [packages I maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=m-pilia) on the [Arch Linux User Repository](https://aur.archlinux.org/) (AUR).
