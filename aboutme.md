Native of Sardinia, I moved to Sweden for my master studies in computer science
at Uppsala University.

I love opera and classical music.  I am an enthusiast [Arch
Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) user.

I am not into social media, but on this website you can find some resources
related to my activity.
