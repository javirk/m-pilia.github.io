I am a computer scientist with focus is on image analysis, programming, and
machine learning, but I tend to get involved in any problem that can fit in the
memory of a computer (and sometimes on problems that cannot really fit).

I am native of Sardinia, where I studied music and math. After earning my
diploma in viola and a couple degrees in math and computer science, I moved to
Sweden for my master studies at Uppsala Universitet.  I am currently working on
my master thesis on a project about
[Imiomics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169966) at Akademiska
Sjukuset.

I love opera and classical music.  I am an enthusiast [Arch
Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) user.
