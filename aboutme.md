I am a computer scientist with focus is on image analysis, programming theory,
and machine learning, but I tend to get involved in any problem that can fit in
the memory of a computer (and sometimes on problems that cannot really fit).

I am native of Sardinia, where I studied music and math. After earning my
diploma in viola and a couple degrees in math and computer science, I moved to
Sweden for my master studies in computer science at Uppsala University, where I
am now employed as a Ph.D. student in digital image analysis.

I love opera and classical music.  I am an enthusiast [Arch
Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) user.

I am not into social media, but on this website you can find some
resources related to my activity.
