I am a computer scientist with wide and weird interests, that tend to expand
and evolve with time. My focus is on image analysis, programming, and machine
learning, but I tend to get involved in any problem that can fit in the memory
of a computer (and sometimes on problems that cannot really fit).

I am native of Sardinia, where I studied music and math. After earning my
diploma in viola and a couple degrees in math and computer science, I decided
that summer in Sardinia was way too hot for me and I moved to the lovely
country of Sweden, where I can enjoy a fresh climate, a beautiful environment,
and I can do my master studies at Uppsala Universitet.  I am currently working
on my master thesis on a project about
[Imiomics](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0169966) at Akademiska
Sjukuset.

I like programming theory and to constantly learn new paradigms, since I think
it is nice to have the right tools for different tasks.  I am an enthusiast
[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/), [KDE](https://www.kde.org/), and
[vim](http://www.vim.org/) user.

I love opera and classical music. I am a bit biased toward string instruments,
probably because of my background, but I really like to listen to everything.
I should admit I have a weakness for Wiener Klassik, especially Mozart, but my
listening intrest ranges from Monteverdi to Ligeti.
